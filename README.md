### About ###

jhuPool is an Android application that matches members of the Johns Hopkins University community (all affiliates with a JHED) traveling from Homewood campus to a specific place, or from a specific place to Homewood campus.

Developed by Will Matteson, Vivian Tsai, and Sarah Zappone in Spring 2017.

### Using jhuPool ###

Users sign in to jhuPool using their Facebook and JHED logins. The platform is intended to connect riders traveling to the same place at the same time; riders then have the option to chat on Facebook Messenger in order to decide whether to share an Uber, Lyft, Zipcar, or one of the riderâ€™s cars to their destination. Users are also free to decide whether to split costs by cash, Venmo, or within the Uber/Lyft app.

Since this app does not currently have access to JHED account information, we have temporarily created an array of JHEDs to be accepted during login (see code).
