# About jhuPool #

jhuPool is an Android application that matches members of the Johns Hopkins University community (affiliates with a JHED) going from Homewood campus to the same place, or from the same place returning to Homewood campus. Users sign in to jhuPool using their Facebook and JHED logins. The platform is intended to connect riders going the same place at the same time; they  then have the option to chat on Facebook messenger and decide whether to share an Uber, Lyft, Zipcar, or one of the rider’s car’s to their destination. The users are free to decide whether to split costs by cash, Venmo, or within the Uber/Lyft app.

### Login ###

Users are required to sign in with both their Facebook username and their JHED (since we don't have access to a databse of all of the JHEDs and their passwords, we have temporarily created an array of JHEDs to be accepted; this currently contains "wmattes2," "vtsai5," "szappon1," and "rkinney4").
